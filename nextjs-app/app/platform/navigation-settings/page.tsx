The Navigation Builder lets you define your sidebar structure through a visual, drag-and-drop interface. It lives inside the **File Explorer** as a dedicated **Navigation** tab, alongside the Files and Media tabs.

## Structure
Navigation is organized into three levels:

- **Section** - a top-level area of your site (e.g., "Docs", "API Reference"). Each section appears as a tab below the site header and has its own sidebar. Sections are defined by a label, URL slug, and docs directory.
- **Category** - a group label within a section's sidebar (e.g., "Getting Started")
- **Link** - an individual page entry within a category, defined by a slug and title

## Drag-and-drop reordering
You can reorder items at every level by dragging their handles:

- **Drag categories** between sections or within the same section to change their position
- **Drag links** between categories or within the same category to reorder them

## Managing sections
- Click **Add Section** in the toolbar to create a new section. Fill in the label, slug, and directory fields.
- Click the **edit** button on a section header to open its edit modal, where you can update the label, slug, and directory.
- Delete a section from its edit modal using the delete button. The root section cannot be deleted.

### The default section
One section should have an empty slug (\`""\`). This is the default/root section that serves pages at the root URL. Pages not assigned to any other section belong here.

### Frontmatter-based sections
You can also define sections purely through page frontmatter without using the Navigation Builder. Add a \`section\` field to your MDX frontmatter and Doccupine will create sections automatically. See the [Sections documentation](/sections) for details.

## Managing categories
- Click **Add Category** within a section to create a new group
- Click the **edit** button on a category to open its edit modal, where you can rename it or delete it

## Adding links
Within each category, click **Add files** to open a popover that lists available MDX files not yet included in the navigation. You can:

- **Search** by file name to filter the list
- **Select** one or more files using checkboxes
- Click **Add** to insert them as links in the category

To remove a link, click the **delete** button next to it.

## Regenerate from files
The toolbar includes a **Regenerate** button that rebuilds the entire navigation tree from your MDX files' frontmatter (\`category\`, \`categoryOrder\`, and \`order\` fields). A confirmation modal appears before any existing manual navigation is replaced.

<Callout type="warning">
  Regenerating from files replaces your current navigation structure. This cannot be undone.
</Callout>

## Auto-generated vs. manual
If you don't configure navigation at all, Doccupine automatically builds your sidebar from page frontmatter. The Navigation Builder is only needed when you want explicit control over the order and grouping.

## How it works
When you save, the Navigation Builder writes two files to your repository as pending changes:

- \`navigation.json\` - the category and link structure for each section
- \`sections.json\` - the list of sections with their labels, slugs, and directories

**Array format** for single-section sites (\`navigation.json\`):
\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "label": "Getting Started",
    "links": [
      { "slug": "getting-started", "title": "Quick Start" }
    ]
  }
]
\`\`\`

**Object format** for multi-section sites (\`navigation.json\`):
\`\`\`json
{
  "": [
    { "label": "General", "links": [{ "slug": "", "title": "Introduction" }] }
  ],
  "api": [
    { "label": "Auth", "links": [{ "slug": "api/auth", "title": "Authentication" }] }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

**Sections** (\`sections.json\`):
\`\`\`json
[
  { "label": "Docs", "slug": "" },
  { "label": "API Reference", "slug": "api" }
]
\`\`\``;
