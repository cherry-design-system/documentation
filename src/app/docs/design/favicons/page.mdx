1. **Favicons**
    - Sizes: 32x32px (standard) and 16x16px (small).
    - Favicons appear in browser tabs, bookmarks, and other places where your website is listed. They help users quickly identify your site.
2. **Apple Touch Icons**
    - These icons are specifically for iOS devices (like iPhones and iPads).
    - Size: 180x180px.
    - When users add your website to their home screen, this icon is displayed.

4. **Google Manifest Icons**
    - These are for Android devices.
    - Sizes: 256x256px and 192x192px.
