# Installation -  Develop

There are two main ways to install Cherry Styled Components into your project. You can either clone the main repository and customize the components to your liking, or you can install the library from npmjs and start using the components right away.

## Implementation Options

### Direct Repository Cloning:

-   Clone the main Cherry repository.
-   Dive into the components’ code.
-   Customize to your heart’s content.
-   Ideal for extensive modifications.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cherry-design-system/styled-components.git
```

### NPM Installation:

-   Install the Cherry library from npmjs.
-   Import components directly into your project.
-   Get started quickly.
-   Perfect for smaller projects or rapid development.

```bash
npm i cherry-styled-components
```
Feel free to explore Cherry’s React components and choose the path that suits your project best. That’s it! Happy coding!

# Theme Context

Always make sure to wrap your application in the **CherryThemeProvider** component. Ensure that your theme prop is passed down correctly. Here’s an example of how to do this:

```tsx
import { CherryThemeProvider, theme } from "cherry-styled-components";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <CherryThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </CherryThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

# Next.js

When integrating Cherry Styled Components into your Next.js app, pay attention to how you import them. To ensure compatibility with compiled modules, follow this approach. First install both dependencies:

```bash
npm i cherry-styled-components styled-components
```

Make sure to always import uncompiled components from:
```jsx
"cherry-styled-components/src/lib"
```

To render the CSS when using Cherry React Components in your Next.js app, follow these instructions:

1. Open your **layout.tsx** file.
2. Wrap your entire application in the following components:

```tsx
import {
  StyledComponentsRegistry,
  CherryThemeProvider,
} from "cherry-styled-components/src/lib";
```

Make sure you pass down the theme prop. Here’s how it should look:

```tsx
import {
  StyledComponentsRegistry,
  CherryThemeProvider,
  theme,
} from "cherry-styled-components/src/lib";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <StyledComponentsRegistry>
          <CherryThemeProvider theme={theme}>
            {children}
          </CherryThemeProvider>
        </StyledComponentsRegistry>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

By following these steps, your Cherry components will be styled correctly, **Next.js** requires these additional steps because it uses server-side rendering.
