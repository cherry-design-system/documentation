# Installation

## Implementation Options

### Direct Repository Cloning:

-   Clone the main Cherry repository.
-   Dive into the components’ code.
-   Customize to your heart’s content.
-   Ideal for extensive modifications.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cherry-design-system/styled-components.git
```

### NPM Installation:

-   Install the Cherry library from npmjs.
-   Import components directly into your project.
-   Get started quickly.
-   Perfect for smaller projects or rapid development.

Feel free to explore Cherry’s React components and choose the path that suits your project best. Happy coding!

```bash
npm i cherry-styled-components
```

That’s it! You’re ready to start using Cherry components in your project.

# Next.js

When integrating Cherry Styled Components into your Next.js app, pay attention to how you import them. To ensure compatibility with compiled modules, follow this approach. First install both dependencies:

```bash
npm i cherry-styled-components styled-components
```

Make sure to always import uncompiled components from:
```jsx
"cherry-styled-components/src/lib"
```

To render the CSS when using Cherry React Components in your Next.js app, follow these instructions:

1. Open your **layout.tsx** file.
2. Wrap your entire application in the following components:

```tsx
import {
  StyledComponentsRegistry,
  CherryThemeProvider,
} from "cherry-styled-components/src/lib";
```

Here’s how it should look:

```tsx
import {
  StyledComponentsRegistry,
  CherryThemeProvider,
} from "cherry-styled-components/src/lib";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <StyledComponentsRegistry>
          <CherryThemeProvider>
            {children}
          </CherryThemeProvider>
        </StyledComponentsRegistry>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

By following these steps, your Cherry components will be styled correctly, **Next.js** requires these additional steps because it uses server-side rendering.
